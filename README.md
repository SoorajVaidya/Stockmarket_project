Project Overview: Stock Analysis Tool with Streamlit
Project Name: Stock Analysis and Signal Generator

*Purpose:
To provide buy and sell signals for stocks based on technical indicators.
To predict the future direction of stock prices using an LSTM model.
To retrieve and display relevant news articles related to the selected stock.


*Technology Stack:S
Frontend: Streamlit for the GUI.
Backend: Python for processing and generating signals.
Machine Learning: LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model for predicting stock price direction.
APIs:
Financial data APIs for fetching stock prices, technical indicators, and news.


*Key Features:
Input: Users can enter the stock symbol of their choice.
Technical Indicators:
RSI (Relative Strength Index): Identifies overbought or oversold conditions.
MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence): Provides trend-following momentum indicators.
Bollinger Bands: Measures market volatility and identifies potential overbought or oversold conditions.
Moving Average: Smooths out price data to identify the trend direction.
Buy/Sell Signals: Generates buy or sell signals based on the analysis of the above indicators.
LSTM Model: Predicts the future direction of stock prices based on historical data.
News Retrieval: Fetches and displays the latest news articles related to the stock for additional context.


*Usage:
Step 1: Run the Streamlit application.
Step 2: Enter the stock symbol in the input field.
Step 3: View the generated buy/sell signals along with the relevant technical indicators.
Step 4: Review the predicted future direction of the stock using the LSTM model.
Step 5: Check the latest news related to the stock for a well-rounded analysis.


*Installation Instructions:
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Streamlit application: streamlit run app.py


*Future Enhancements:
Add more technical indicators for more comprehensive analysis.
Improve the accuracy of the LSTM model by incorporating more data.
Implement a historical data analysis feature.
